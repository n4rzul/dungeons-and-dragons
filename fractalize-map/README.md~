** Fractalize Map **

There's two main files in this program:

* record-clicks.html
* fractalize-map.py

The first one allows you to reclick if you want new points (and displays photo.jpg as a reference).

The second one takes those points and fractalizes them.

** record-clicks.html **

To use record-clicks.html, first open it in your browser (I used Firefox). It relies on jQuery, but loading the files locally wasn't making Firefox happy, so open the console and type:

    run($)

and then start clicking and they will show up in your console. Then copy the text from the console and run:

    sed -e "1d; s/.* //;" > my-filename-for-this-island.points

then paste the copied text into your terminal to convert it into the right format.

** fractalize-map.py **
